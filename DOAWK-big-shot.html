       I have been keeping up with all of the Diary Wimpy Kid books since I was in 3rd grade! These books
       are funny and are realistic, as said in the subheading. "Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Big Shot" by Jeff Kinney,
       is a book for all ages to enjoy reading. This specific story tells the tale of a boy named Greg, in this book
       His mother suggests joining a team sport, claiming it is a lot of fun and is good to build teamwork. Greg finally
       gives in to playing basketball. Reading this book will let you follow his small basketball journey, and the
       regular problems in his middle school. All of the books in this series is formatted as if Greg has been
       writing his goals, plans, hardships, and successes into one big diary! This book is easy to read so I recommend
       to almost anyone!
