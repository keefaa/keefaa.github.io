    <h1>Aggie and Me</h1>
    <h2>A realistic fiction story</h2>
    <p>

        I am back with another book to share with you guys, it is called "Aggie and me" by R. J. Palacio!!
        "Aggie and Me" is the sequel to the book "Wonder", so if you are planning to read Aggie and
        I make sure to read Wonder as well. The book Wonder is about a boy who had multiple facial
        surgeries because of his facial deformity. Because of this he was homeschooled until 5th grade.
        Wonder is the story of how this boy (named Aggie) overcomes challenges at school. Aggie and Me
        is the sequel to this book which shows the perspective of the people that surround him. Happy reading! See
        you next time!
